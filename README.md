The page is deployed on:

https://werdziur.github.io/book-shop/main.html

The main aim of creating a BookShoop website was practicing as many DOM manipulation methods as possible and DOM API 
(the whole page is created through JS, only basic tags were added via HTML).


A user is able to:
look through the books' catalog, 
see the description of a particular book, 
add a book to the bag (by clicking to the button or by drag and drop functionality), 
choose the appropriate date and address to deliver.

Total price is calculated and after confirming the order the user is moved to the page with a form. The form is protected by many validation points. The user is forced to fill all mandatory fields and in case something is missing, the appropriate information is displayed next to the row.
After population of all required information, the user can confirm the order and will see the final page with address and expected delivery date.
The BookShop page is responsive.
