The main aim of creating a BookShoop website was practicing as many DOM manipulation methods as possible and DOM API 
(the whole page is created through JS, only basic tags were added via HTML).


A user is able to:
look through the books' catalog, 
see the description of a particular book, 
add a book to the bag (by clicking to the button or by drag and drop functionality), 
choose the appropriate date and address to deliver.

Total price is calculated and after confirming the order the user sees the final page with address and expected delivery date.
The BookShop page is responsive.
